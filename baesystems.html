    <h3 style="text-align:center;">BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>I became a technical intern at BAE Systems, one of the leading defense contractors in the world. During my time with them, I learned alot about project management and the real world structure of engineering, as well as finally applying some of the more technical courses in the ME courseload. It was quite a world away from the more free spirited experience with my Hyperloop team or even my own personal projects, but this internship gave me the experience in a professional and organized work environment. </p>

      <p>One of my first assignments was to re-engineer a mechanism used for torque checks. I was given a set of requirements along with a set of extra pointers and I happily went to my desk to start modelling in the brand new system I just learned, Creo Parametric. I had sketched out some concept generations in my journal, but I was dead-set on fullfilling those extra pointers. After a couple of days, I met with my supervisor for a general review on where things were headed, and got some advice that I immediately implemented. After a couple more questions and a few more days, I finished up and presented my work to my supervisor. In hindsight after my senior design courses, this is definitely not the correct way to design and engineer a part. I should have contacted my supervisor much more frequently and with my ideas and concepts recorded in a readable format. I should have documented all the steps along the way, and should have used a proper Pugh to determine which design I would take. After this assignment was completed, this realization was definitely something that I kept in mind, and still do. </p>

      <p>After the design assignment, I received a couple of heat transfer and machine elements problems for a humidity check and screw torque check, respectively. It was fun and exciting to go back and review all the material I had gone through, and used my pen and paper extensively. At the end of these assignments, I came away with reinvigorated engineering might, and provided some very useful information and confirmation for some BAE Systems products.</p>

      <p>Intermittently, I would receive some work assisting the operations branch. Most of the problems originated from the operators, and involved looking through some engineering documentation to finalize decisions. I learned how to use a Product Data Management service from Enovia, and how to read though specification sheets and assembly instructions to piece together the purpose of a feature.</p>
