    <h3 style="text-align:center;">BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>I participated in the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition II with the team Texas Guadaloop. Our task was to levitate a half-ton pod down a track capable of going over 600 mph. Many of our parts were designed and manufactured in-house, and as a result I got to get hands on experience with an incredible piece of machinery.</p>

      <p>My one of my primary focuses was in manufacturing, where I would create and assembly components. Nearly every week I would be in the machine shop, grinding out piece after piece with the milling machine and the lathe. This not only reduced cost by using in-house manufacturing, it gave me the experience to design products that are relatively simplier to produce. For example, I encountered some critical problems with the suspension system based on old CAD and had to work against the clock in a quick redesign process. In the redesign, I made sure to account for the mistakes of the old model, tool placement for hand drills, and clearance for the welding tip. After this was finished, we had a working suspension just in time for the first public reveal of the pod. </p>

      <p>During the one week of testing and approval, we faced the gauntlet of SpaceX employees critquing every small detail and every possible flaw. Everytime they found an error, the following night was committed to fixing that error. I was jumping between fixing the magnetic brakes at an auto shop to conducting FEA and CFD analysis at the AirBnB to bending and swageing pneumatic pipes on the competition lot. After the slow crawl through the safety and communication checks, competition weekend arrived. After all of our hard work, we earned ourselves an Innovation Award!</p>
