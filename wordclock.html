    <p>On my own time, I have built a special clock that displays the time in word format. This was my first foray into electrical engineering, and I had an absolute blast with it. A microprocessor controls an array of LEDs that light up a predetermined pattern under a printed template. </p>

      <p>This being my first time dealing with circuits of any kind, my first hurdle was designing the board. After some digging around I decided that the best way to control all 121 LEDs was by using an Arduino with daisy-chained shift registers. I then started to design my circuit card to hold all the shift registers and all of the output ports, and afterwards used a PCB milling machine to create my very first PCB. I designed and printed the case that holds all the wires, connected and soldered everything together, and programmed a rudimentary parsing program that runs the clock. </p>

      <p>A couple of months later, I had the opportunity to improve upon my design. This previous clock was indeed my first model, and was ripe with issues. The wiring from PCB to LEDs took up a significant amount of space, and were hopelessly tangled. I solved this issue by designing a smaller modular board that had both the shift registers and the LEDs soldered on. These smaller boards would then link to each other with much shorter wire length.  </p>

      <p>The old clock would develop quite a time delay, and I soon realized that internal microprocessor clocks are inaccurate. I would have to implement an auxiliary unit with a crystal specifically designed to keep time. Also, to foolproof the eventual decay of this auxiliary unit, I decided to install some buttons so that the user can adjust the time of their own accord. Finally, I implemented a new framework in the code that made it much easier to switch templates and letters. After a couple of weeks, I managed to complete this new clock. </p>
